	Abstract = {BackgroundStroke is a leading cause of disability. The ability to live independently after stroke depends largely on the reduction of motor impairment and the recovery of motor function. Accurate prediction of motor recovery assists rehabilitation planning and supports realistic goal setting by clinicians and patients. Initial impairment is negatively related to degree of recovery, but inter-individual variability makes accurate prediction difficult. Neuroimaging and neurophysiological assessments can be used to measure the extent of stroke damage to the motor system and predict subsequent recovery of function, but these techniques are not yet used routinely.},

	Abstract = {Swift is a new programming language developed by Apple for creating iOS and Mac OS X applications. Intended to eventually replace Objective-C as Apple's language of choice, Swift needs to convince developers to switch over to the new language. Apple has promised that Swift will be faster than Objective-C, as well as offer more modern language features, be very safe, and be easy to learn and use. In this thesis I test these claims by creating an iOS application entirely in Swift as well as benchmarking two different algorithms. I find that while Swift is faster than Objective-C, it does not see the speedup projected by Apple. I also conclude that Swift offers many advantages over Objective-C, and is easy for developers to learn and use. However there are some weak areas of Swift involving interactions with Objective-C and the strictness of the compiler that can make the language difficult to work with. Despite these difficulties Swift is overall a successful project for Apple and should attract new developers to their platform.},
